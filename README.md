## Context:

Boxing matches take place in a ring with two fighters, one dressed in red and the other in blue. Olympic boxing differs from professional boxing: with fewer rounds (3 vs. 12 for professional boxing), fights rarely end in a knockout. More often than not, the outcome is determined by judges who score the fighters on 10 criteria:
- Domination
- Vulnerability
- Positioning
- Quality of Strikes
- Energy Management
- Footwork
- Defense
- Perception and Adjustments
- Rhythm
- Ring Awareness

A research and development firm in Olympic boxing has hired you as a consultant to modernize their workflow. Currently, note-taking is done twice: once with pen and paper and a second time when entering the results into their analysis software. The goal of this project is to develop a mobile application for tablets/phones to replace the paper step and avoid transcribing the same information twice.

Analysts will be the main users, as they will evaluate the matches. Coaches will occasionally want to review certain past evaluated matches. Evaluated boxers also like to receive instant feedback after the match, so a summary page would add a lot of value to the product.
